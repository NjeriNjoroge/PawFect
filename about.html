  <p>Mary Hammond scoured the websites of rescue organisations seeking her perfect match. Having recently lost her beloved 17-year-old border collie, Jess, and having worked as a shepherd with the breed some years previously, Mary had her heart set on another.
    A few days later, a young, nervous border collie arrived at our rehoming centre. She had come from a family home straight into a kennel environment, and the sudden change was a shock. Unbeknown to the timid collie, there was very likely a loving home
    already waiting for her. </p>

      I’ve loved all my dogs, I’ve had dozens. But this one, there’s something a bit special about her.

  <p>As he snuggles up warm and content on the sofa of his new home, Arlo’s frostbitten ears are now the only reminder of his sad, traumatic past. The six-year-old crossbreed was found abandoned on a mountain top in Wales on a freezing cold January day –
    frightened, emaciated and with wounds on the tips of his ears caused by prolonged exposure to the bitter, sub-zero air. Had he not been rescued there and then, he would have soon lost his fight for survival. </p>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
      When I look at the pictures of him before, he looks like a different dog. I still can’t quite believe that he went through all that. His ears are just a constant reminder."

  <p>It’s impossible to imagine the pain and fear that Pippa must have endured as she dragged her tiny, injured body around the streets.The four-year-old Jack Russell was found as a stray, struggling to walk due to a fractured pelvis and blind in one eye,
    as well as suffering with a nasty ear infection which impaired her hearing. It’s not known if Pippa was abandoned with her injuries or caught up in an accident afterwards, but her pelvis had been left untreated for some time and had begun to heal
    in the wrong position. </p>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
      Everyone was amazed when Pippa came to us in her sorry state – for a
      dog that had been through so much and been let down so badly she was
      still so friendly and loving and wanted a cuddle with
      everyone - it was heart breaking!"

  <p>Up until 1997, being born to look like one of these types signalled an automatic death sentence for these dogs – even if they had never shown any aggressive behaviour. Death was mandatory. Looks could literally kill. </p>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
      I once had a guy shout at me in a train station, ‘You shouldn’t have that type of dog, they’re dangerous’, which was quite intimidating.
