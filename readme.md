### Description of Project
PawFect Match is a site where interested individuals can adopt rescued dogs. We provide information
on which dogs can be adopted, how to care for them and we also have success stories from people who have used our site before. What makes this site standout from other adoption sites is that we follow up with the homes that have our dogs and we help you care for them if they need special attention.
The organization is funded through donations and well wishers.
